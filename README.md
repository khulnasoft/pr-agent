## News and Updates

### Jan 25, 2025

The open-source GitHub organization was updated:
`https://github.com/khulnasoft/pr-insight` â†’
`https://github.com/khulnasoft/pr-insight`

The Docker image should be redirected automatically to the new location.
However, if you have any issues, please update the GitHub action Docker image from
`uses: Khulnasoft/pr-insight@main`
to
`uses: khulnasoft-ai/pr-insight@main`


### Jan 2, 2025

New tool  [/Implement](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/tools/implement/) (ðŸ’Ž), which converts human code review discussions and feedback into ready-to-commit code changes.


### Jan 1, 2025

Update logic and [documentation](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/usage-guide/changing_a_model/#ollama) for running local models via Ollama.

### December 30, 2024

Following feedback from the community, we have addressed two vulnerabilities identified in the open-source PR-Insight project. The fixes are now included in the newly released version (v0.26), available as of today.

### December 25, 2024

The `review` tool previously included a legacy feature for providing code suggestions (controlled by '--pr_reviewer.num_code_suggestion'). This functionality has been deprecated. Use instead the [`improve`](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/tools/improve/) tool, which offers higher quality and more actionable code suggestions.

### December 2, 2024

Open-source repositories can now freely use Khulnasoft Merge, and enjoy easy one-click installation using a marketplace [app](https://github.com/apps/khulnasoft-merge-pro-for-open-source).

<kbd><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0838724-87b9-43b0-ab62-73739a3a855c" width="512"></kbd>

See [here](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/installation/pr_insight_pro/) for more details about installing Khulnasoft Merge for private repositories.


### November 18, 2024

A new mode was enabled by default for code suggestions - `--pr_code_suggestions.focus_only_on_problems=true`:

- This option reduces the number of code suggestions received
- The suggestions will focus more on identifying and fixing code problems, rather than style considerations like best practices, maintainability, or readability.
- The suggestions will be categorized into just two groups: "Possible Issues" and "General".

Still, if you prefer the previous mode, you can set `--pr_code_suggestions.focus_only_on_problems=false` in the [configuration file](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/usage-guide/configuration_options/).

## Try it now

Try the GPT-4 powered PR-Insight instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@KhulnaSoft-Agent` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The agent will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:
```
@KhulnaSoft-Agent /review
```
and the agent will respond with a review of your PR.

Note that this is a promotional bot, suitable only for initial experimentation.
It does not have 'edit' access to your repo, for example, so it cannot update the PR description or add labels (`@KhulnaSoft-Agent /describe` will publish PR description as a comment). In addition, the bot cannot be used on private repositories, as it does not have access to the files there.


To set up your own PR-Insight, see the [Installation](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/installation/) section below.
Note that when you set your own PR-Insight or use Khulnasoft hosted PR-Insight, there is no need to mention `@KhulnaSoft-Agent ...`. Instead, directly start with the command, e.g., `/ask ...`.

3. **Improved support** - Khulnasoft Merge users will receive priority support, and will be able to request new features and capabilities.
4. **Extra features** -In addition to the benefits listed above, Khulnasoft Merge will emphasize more customization, and the usage of static code analysis, in addition to LLM logic, to improve results.
See [here](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/overview/pr_insight_pro/) for a list of features available in Khulnasoft Merge.



## How it works

The following diagram illustrates PR-Insight tools and their flow:

Check out the [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) page for more details on how we convert a code diff to a manageable LLM prompt

## Why use PR-Insight?

A reasonable question that can be asked is: `"Why use PR-Insight? What makes it stand out from existing tools?"`

Here are some advantages of PR-Insight:

- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single GPT-4 call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.
- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.
- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the '/review' tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_insight/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.
- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Action, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama2).


## Data privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Insight

- If you host PR-Insight with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

### Khulnasoft-hosted Khulnasoft Merge ðŸ’Ž

- When using Khulnasoft Merge ðŸ’Ž, hosted by Khulnasoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, Khulnasoft-hosted Khulnasoft Merge will use Khulnasoftâ€™s proprietary models â€” if this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” Khulnasoft Merge will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

### Khulnasoft Merge Chrome extension

- The [Khulnasoft Merge Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/khulnasoft-merge-ai-powered-cod/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Insight tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of Khulnasoft-Merge.
