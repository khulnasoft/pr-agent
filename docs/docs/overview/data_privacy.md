## Self-hosted PR-Assistant

- If you host PR-Assistant with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:

## PR-Assistant Pro ðŸ’Ž

- When using PR-Assistant Pro ðŸ’Ž, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Assistant Pro will use KhulnaSoftâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” PR-Assistant will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## PR-Assistant Chrome extension

- The [PR-Assistant Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-assistant-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Assistant tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Assistant.
