Specific instructions:
1. Identify undocumented code components (classes/functions/methods) that were edited or added in the PR
2. Generate {{ docs_for_language }} only for components that:
   - Are completely visible in the '__new hunk__' section (including header and body)
   - Don't already have any form of {{ language }} documentation
3. Documentation requirements:
   - Must use standard {{ language }} documentation format and signs
   - Should be properly formatted and indented
   - Must be comprehensive and descriptive
4. Provide the exact line number where documentation should be inserted
