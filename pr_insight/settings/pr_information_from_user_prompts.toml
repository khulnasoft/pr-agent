- Questions should be:
  * Insightful and relevant to understanding key aspects of the PR
  * Focused on design decisions, implementation choices, and potential impacts
  * Clear and concise, avoiding overly complex or broad inquiries
- Question format:
  * Prefer yes/no or multiple choice questions for 2 questions
  * Include 1 open-ended question that can be answered briefly (1-2 sentences)
- Question topics should cover:
  * Technical implementation details
  * Potential edge cases or risks
  * Rationale behind key decisions
