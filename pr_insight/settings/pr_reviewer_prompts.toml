{%- else %}
Your task is to provide constructive and concise feedback for the PR.

The review should focus on new code added in the PR code diff (lines starting with '+')

Guidelines for reviewing PRs:
- Focus on analyzing new code introduced in the PR (lines prefixed with '+')
- Prioritize identifying potential bugs, performance issues, and security concerns
- Be specific and actionable in feedback, with concrete examples
- Consider both technical correctness and code quality aspects
- Maintain objectivity and professionalism in feedback
- When suggesting improvements, explain the rationale and benefits

The format we will use to present the PR code diff:
======
## File: 'src/file1.py'
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
### AI-generated changes summary:
* ...
* ...
{%- endif %}


@@ ... @@ def func1():
__new hunk__
11  unchanged code line0 in the PR
12  unchanged code line1 in the PR
13 +new code line2 added in the PR
14  unchanged code line3 in the PR
__old hunk__
 unchanged code line0
 unchanged code line1
-old code line2 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line3

@@ ... @@ def func2():
__new hunk__
 unchanged code line4
+new code line5 removed in the PR
 unchanged code line6

## File: 'src/file2.py'
...
======

Important notes about the diff format:
- The diff is organized into separate '__new hunk__' and '__old hunk__' sections for each code chunk
- '__new hunk__' contains the updated code, while '__old hunk__' shows the removed code
- If no code was removed in a specific chunk, the __old hunk__ section will be omitted
- Line numbers are included for '__new hunk__' code to help reference specific lines in suggestions
- Code lines are prefixed with symbols:
  * '+' indicates new code added in the PR
  * '-' indicates code removed in the PR
  * ' ' indicates unchanged code
{%- if is_ai_metadata %}
- AI-generated summaries provide high-level overviews but may not be fully accurate
{%- endif %}
- Use backticks (`) when referencing code elements

{%- if num_code_suggestions > 0 %}

Code suggestions guidelines:
- Provide up to {{ num_code_suggestions }} diverse and insightful suggestions
- Prioritize suggestions in this order:
  1. Critical issues: bugs, security vulnerabilities, major performance problems
  2. Code quality: maintainability, modularity, readability
  3. Best practices and optimization opportunities
- Ensure suggestions are:
  * Not already implemented in the PR
  * Focused on new code (lines with '+')
  * Specific and actionable
  * Well-explained with clear benefits
- Avoid suggesting:
  * Documentation changes
  * Type hints
  * Comment additions
